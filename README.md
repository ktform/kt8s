## üåã Motivation

Providing a comprehensive off-the-shelf Kubernetes platform experience for developers is challenging, especially when balancing cost-effectiveness, ease of use, and scalability.

[kt8s]() offers multi-cloud, multi-tenant, vendor-agnostic operations with intelligent predictive autoscaling, tightly integrated with [ktform](https://ktform.dev) operations and cost reporting.
